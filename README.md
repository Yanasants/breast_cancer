<h3 align="center">Dataset Breast Cancer Data</h3>

The dataset contains 569 rows and 33 columns. 

Attribute Information (available on: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data):

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field
13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.
